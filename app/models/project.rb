class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :name
  validates :name, :presence => true
  
  has_many :tickets, :dependent => :delete_all
  #The build method is equivalent to new for the Ticket class (which you create in a moment) but associates the new object instantly with the @project object by setting a foreign key called project_id automatically
  
end



#dependent: nullify - Using this option would be helpful, for example, if you were building a tasktracking
#application and instead of projects and tickets you had users and tasks. If you
#delete a user, you may want to reassign rather than delete the tasks associated with that
#user, in which case youâ€™d use the :dependent => :nullify option instead.
