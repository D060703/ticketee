  #The :as option on the has_many :permissions association B links your projects to the thing association on the Permission objects.
  

  #The build method is equivalent to new for the Ticket class (which you create in a moment) but associates the new object instantly with the @project object by setting a foreign key called project_id automatically

#dependent: nullify - Using this option would be helpful, for example, if you were building a tasktracking
#application and instead of projects and tickets you had users and tasks. If you
#delete a user, you may want to reassign rather than delete the tasks associated with that
#user, in which case youâ€™d use the :dependent => :nullify option instead.
